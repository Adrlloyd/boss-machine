# Boss Machine

## Project Overview

Create an entire API to serve information to a Boss Machine, a unique management application for today's most accomplished (evil) entrepreneurs. Create routes to manage your 'minions', your brilliant 'million dollar ideas', and to handle all the annoying meetings that keep getting added to your busy schedule.

## How to Begin

Once you have the project downloaded, you'll need to run some terminal commands to get the application started. First, open the root project directory in your terminal. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies of this project and build the front-end application. Once it has finished installing, you can run `npm run start` to begin your server. You'll see `Server listening on port 4001` in the terminal.

#### Routes Required

- `/api/minions`
  - GET /api/minions to get an array of all minions.
  - POST /api/minions to create a new minion and save it to the database.
  - GET /api/minions/:minionId to get a single minion by id.
  - PUT /api/minions/:minionId to update a single minion by id.
  - DELETE /api/minions/:minionId to delete a single minion by id.
- `/api/ideas`
  - GET /api/ideas to get an array of all ideas.
  - POST /api/ideas to create a new idea and save it to the database.
  - GET /api/ideas/:ideaId to get a single idea by id.
  - PUT /api/ideas/:ideaId to update a single idea by id.
  - DELETE /api/ideas/:ideaId to delete a single idea by id.
- `/api/meetings`
  - GET /api/meetings to get an array of all meetings.
  - POST /api/meetings to create a new meeting and save it to the database.
  - DELETE /api/meetings to delete _all_ meetings from the database.

For all `/api/minions` and `/api/ideas routes`, any POST or PUT requests will send their new/updated resources in the request body. POST request bodies will not have an `id` property, you will have to set it based on the next id in sequence.

For `/api/meetings` POST route, no request body is necessary, as meetings are generated automatically by the server upon request. Use the provided `createMeeting` function exported from **db.js** to create a new meeting object.
